What should you use in your code
Lock and Condition objects or synchronized methods? Here is our recommendation:

• It is best to use neither Lock/Condition nor the synchronized keyword. In many
situations, you can use one of the mechanisms of the java.util.concurrent
package that do all the locking for you. For example, in Section 12.5.1,
“Blocking Queues,” on p. 781, you will see how to use a blocking queue
to synchronize threads that work on a common task. You should also
explore parallel streams—see Chapter 1 of Volume II.

• If the synchronized keyword works for your situation, by all means, use it.
You’ll write less code and have less room for error. Listing 12.5 shows
the bank example, implemented with synchronized methods.

• Use Lock/Condition if you really need the additional power that these
constructs give you.
